Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in solids.
X-ray diffraction is one of the primary methods used in crystallography.
In crystallographic analysis, the unit cell dimensions are crucial for determining the symmetry.
The Bragg equation relates the wavelength of X-rays to the diffraction angle and lattice spacing.
